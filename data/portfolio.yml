    title: Python abstractions for data manipulation in Excel documents
    description: >-
                    I developed a Python abstraction for efficient data manipulation in Excel sheets.
                    This provides a grammar to easily extract tables of different formats from anywhere in the Excel
                    sheets, the flexibility of the python library "pandas" for table manipulation, while at the same time allowing
                    the user to write values to the Excel sheets in-place while maintaining the integrity of all the formulae.

    title: Google Summer of Code - R package for interval regression
    description: >-
                    I developed the first R package for interval regression with elastic net penalty
                    and a coordinate descent solver supporting logistic, Gaussian, and Weibull losses.
                    I co-Mentored a GSoC 2017 project which continued this work.

  #                   We developed a method for sequence prediction in images by separately learning

    title: Graph based relationship queries
    description: >-
                    I extracted rich data about around 13,000 people, companies, and universities from a start-up listing website.
                    I then built a custom graph query layer over Redis to store the data and execute queries
                    involving complex relationships between the entities. For instance, I was able to execute queries of the form
                    "People living in SF who previously worked at X and studied at Y".

    title: IoT based solution for smart home gardens
    description: >-
                    My team won the first position in the MyWired Startup Mechanics Open Hackathon 2016, Bangalore.
                    We developed an IoT based solution for extensible indoor gardens. It would water your plants automatically
                    when needed and send real-time statistics about soil, sunlight, and plant health direct to your mobile phones!

    title: Learning applications at Jaaga
    description: >-
                    I volunteered at a non-profit, Jaaga, for developing applications to teach under-privileged children
                    basic numeracy and language skills. While there, I worked on a chat-bot back-end for an Android application
                    being developed towards this goal. I also experimented with other ideas for interactive learning applications, like
                    generating natural language questions just from images to be used to supplement the learning from textbooks and
                    generating fill-in-the-blanks questions from book sentences.

    title: Hidden Markov Models from scratch in python
    description: >-
                    I implemented Hidden Markov Models in python from scratch - including forwards-backwards algorithm and Viterbi decoding
                    I trained them for classification of emotions in speech samples from the Berlin emotion database.
